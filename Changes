Revision history for Perl extension XML::Elemental.

2.011 Jan 01 2008
    - Nothing new. Just a distribution sans the %$!*#~@ OS X
      resource files. (Note to self add 'export
      COPYFILE_DISABLE=1' in .bash_profile on all Leopard
      machines.)
      
2.01  Dec 31 2007
    - POTENTIAL BREAK: Rearranged code to address the
      boneheaded oversight of using a circular reference in
      the parse tree and failing to breaking up. This caused
      memory to leak. The change involved making
      XML::Elemental::Document a subclass of
      Object::Destroyer that works as a proxy to the real
      object implementation. This *should* be entirely
      transparent to existing code; however, there is the
      possibility that I overlooked some usage scenario that
      this change will break.
